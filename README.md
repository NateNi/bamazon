# Bamazon
## What the project does
This project creates an Amazon-like storefront to take orders from customers and deplete stock from the stores's inventory in a MySQL database.
## Why the project is useful
In addition to displaying the information about each available product, the project will allow the user to "place orders" on a desired quantity of items and display an updated total.  A warning message will appear if the order quantity exceeds the inventory quantity.
## How users can get started with the project
After using npm to install inquirer and mySQL, run the program in terminal (use "node bamazonCustomer").  The store will greet you and immediately print out all product information.  After this point, follow the inquirer prompts to enter a product ID and order quantity.  If all fields are valid, your current total will be displayed along with an updated list of the products. The process can be repeated with as many items as the user wishes to order.  For examples of the functioning code, please refer to the pictures below.
